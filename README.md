# Using Tokyo's population forecasts and building heights to identify the next Hot Spot

## Start & Goal
#### I want to create this article with the aim of conducting a spatial comparative analysis of Tokyo. 
#### As a background to reading spatial data, I considered integrating population forecasts. 
#### Initially, I explored visualizing architectural heights, sizes, and population distribution, but there was too much information to fit into a single visual. Therefore, I displayed the population forecasts separately in charts.
